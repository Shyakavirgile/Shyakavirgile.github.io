            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Shyaka Virgile Iradukunda. Am Rwandan. I can be 6 foot 1 on a good day and on a bad day I really donâ€™t want to know. I was born and realised in Kigali Rwanda. I studied my primary in a French school and went in Uganda for my high school. I like soccer both watching and playing.</p>

            <h2>My best motivational quote</h2>
